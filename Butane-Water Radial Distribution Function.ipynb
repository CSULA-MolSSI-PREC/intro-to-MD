    "It was easy enough for us to see that the butane molecules clumped together (i.e., aggregated) in water, but how could we quantify this observation?\n",
    "\n",
    "One possibility is to compute a **radial distribution function**. Briefly, a radial distribution function (or **rdf**) computes the probability of finding a given pair of atoms at each distance and normalizes this by the average number density of those atoms in the simulation box. That might sound complicated – and it is! – but the basic idea is this: an rdf value of 1.0 indicates that probability of finding that pair of atoms at the specified distance is equal to what we would expect if the atoms were uniformly distributed (no clumping!) in the simulation box. rdf values greater than 1.0 indicate that there are more atom pairs observed at that distance than expected (enrichment, indicative of aggregation), whereas values less than 1.0 indicate that there are fewer atom pairs observed at that distance than expected (depletion, indicative of exclusion). \n",
