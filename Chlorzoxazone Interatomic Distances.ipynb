    "When we visualized the chlorzoxazone trajectory, we found that the molecule was fairly rigid and had little variation in its structure. One way to characterize the conformational ensemble of this molecule is to compute the distance between a pair of atoms that are far apart and analyze how they vary over the course of the simulation. In what follows, we'll take a look at the distance between the chlorine atom at one end of the molecule and an oxygen atom at the opposite end. "
